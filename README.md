# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository is dedicated to store my solutions for LeetCode challenges. It includes both the problem statement and my code implementation in different programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

Each problem has its own directory containing:
- `README.md`: The problem statement.
- `solution.(py|java|js)`: The solution.
